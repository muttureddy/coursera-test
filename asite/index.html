				  <h2>I Feel Lost In The World</h2>

				 
				  	<br><br>
							
						<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
							<p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&quot;I am a very fun loving person, so it's very hard for me to get sad over things. But lately, it has become so easy for me to lose my smile and spirit. I don't know what exactly, but I become irritated very soon. Maybe, it's a mix of all the scars that my soul has absorbed all these years. So what happens is that I am having a normal day, but suddenly, a thought enters my mind, and I feel a pinch in my heart. You know, like I skip a heartbeat or something. It almost triggers something in my brain, and I get drowned into this deep, dark well. I don't want to, but I keep thinking about it. And before I know it, I am sad. I am so, so sad that it feels as if I just had a heartbreak. But that's not true, I was fine a minute before. So, how can it happen to me?

							You know, I myself try to explain it to me that you think too much. It's nothing. You created this hell for yourself. Just stop overthinking, and you will be fine. I swear I know it's very stupid and crazy. I realize that you might be thinking that I am doing some drama. But I am not. I do realize how it sounds. But it happens to me. How can I explain it to you that I feel helpless when it hits me. I am not a sadist. I want to be happy. I don't want to waste a second of my life thinking about the past. But I get pulled into it. And I try to just ignore it. I open my mobile, and I start to watch a funny video or read a meme. I try to listen to peppy songs. But it doesn't solve it. I can still feel that my soul is stuck somewhere. I feel as if someone caught hold of my heart, and that monster is squeezing my heart into pain. I don't act panicked. I have people around me. So I act all cool. I smile. I laugh. And I try to fake that I am fine. But in those moments of darkness, I feel so helpless.

							I wish someone could come and hug me into peace. Don't cure me. But at least, listen to me. Tell me that you understand how I feel. Tell me that I am not crazy. Tell me that it happens to others too. Tell me that I will be fine. I will be fine, right? I know I will be. I am a fighter. I am not giving up. But will you help me? ðŸ˜Š&nbsp;&quot;

						<h2>Long Distance Friendship</h2>

				  	<br><br>


						<blockquote class="blockquote text-center"><br>
							<p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&quot;
								No-one talks about this, No-one feels it harder but it's as difficult and as beautiful as long distance relationships. A long distance friend is the most beautiful thing a person can have nowadays							.

							In today's world, we bond with people on internet faster than in person. They know me better than anyone and better than I actually know myself.

							Even though we may have our fights, we always make it through the rough patches by just sharing a meme or quote, isn't it?

							I feel like even if we can't see each other physically, Our bond is closer than most. It's so easy to open up to you and go to you with any problems. We always put our hearts on our sleeve and are willing to help at the drop of a hat, which I adore.
							Other than my best friend in real life, you are the most important person in my life.
							<br>
							 
							You're the person who has never left my life, you're been my constant in a world where everyone leaves.

							You've always cared for my well-being and happiness, have never given up on me, which I appreciate. Being friends, it's important to be real with each other and tell eachother anything that's on our minds.
							<br>
							Even oceans away, I still feel as though you're five minutes away from me. I feel emotionally connected to you.

							I honestly don't even know how to put our friendship and our love and bonding for each other into words.
							<br>
							One day, we will be able to meet again and it'll be the best day of our lives. I swear, now it's my mission to meet you.
							<br>
							With Love.	ðŸ˜Š&nbsp;&quot;
							</p>

						<h2>It Hurts When Someone Too close Changes Too Fast</h2>


				  	<br><br>


						<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
							<p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&quot;When a close person changes, it hurts like hell. Not lovers, but they can be friends, more than friends, or just a beautiful relation without any name. You know, the problem is that these people are just too close to you for you to not notice when they change. And when things start to change all of a sudden, your heart sinks. You feel totally cheated and helpless. You can't cry like a heartbroken lover. But your soul screams in its silent pain. It affects you deeply. You start to become restless and rude. You can't tell anyone because no one would understand the gravity of your loss, the suffocation. They will say "as if your lover left you, lol, chill." But how can you chill when your souls felt the warmth in each other's shadow? How can you let it go when it was one strong pillar of your life? How can you move on when you had so many dreams with that person? How can it not affect you when you closed your eyes and prayed for that person?

							Not all relationships need "I love you" to be special. Some people are just too special, and no one else would understand that. You have spent too many special moments for it be just like a passing friendship. It has that charm, that honesty, and that realness that's so rare these days. So when that person chooses to make a special bond an ordinary name on the phonebook, it rips your soul apart. How can you let it become ordinary? How can you just live your life without me being a part of it? How can you stop telling me everything that happens in your life? How can you stop asking me whether I am fine as you saw a sad post from me? How can you not call me to tell me a stupid thing that happened with your relatives? How can you not tell me what your mom taunted you with today? How can you not tell me how you took my name while talking to another person because you are so used to say my name? How? How can you change that? We promised, na. We promised that we will stay the same, always. Then what happened? How can you break my heart and act as if nothing happened? I feel so, so bad, you know. How can you? How?	ðŸ˜Š&nbsp;&quot;
