							<p class="mb-0">&nbsp;&quot;I am a very fun loving person, so it's very hard for me to get sad over things. But lately, it has become so easy for me to lose my smile and spirit. I don't know what exactly, but I become irritated very soon. Maybe, it's a mix of all the scars that my soul has absorbed all these years. So what happens is that I am having a normal day, but suddenly, a thought enters my mind, and I feel a pinch in my heart. You know, like I skip a heartbeat or something. It almost triggers something in my brain, and I get drowned into this deep, dark well. I don't want to, but I keep thinking about it. And before I know it, I am sad. I am so, so sad that it feels as if I just had a heartbreak. But that's not true, I was fine a minute before. So, how can it happen to me?

							You know, I myself try to explain it to me that you think too much. It's nothing. You created this hell for yourself. Just stop overthinking, and you will be fine. I swear I know it's very stupid and crazy. I realize that you might be thinking that I am doing some drama. But I am not. I do realize how it sounds. But it happens to me. How can I explain it to you that I feel helpless when it hits me. I am not a sadist. I want to be happy. I don't want to waste a second of my life thinking about the past. But I get pulled into it. And I try to just ignore it. I open my mobile, and I start to watch a funny video or read a meme. I try to listen to peppy songs. But it doesn't solve it. I can still feel that my soul is stuck somewhere. I feel as if someone caught hold of my heart, and that monster is squeezing my heart into pain. I don't act panicked. I have people around me. So I act all cool. I smile. I laugh. And I try to fake that I am fine. But in those moments of darkness, I feel so helpless.

							I wish someone could come and hug me into peace. Don't cure me. But at least, listen to me. Tell me that you understand how I feel. Tell me that I am not crazy. Tell me that it happens to others too. Tell me that I will be fine. I will be fine, right? I know I will be. I am a fighter. I am not giving up. But will you help me? 😊&nbsp;&quot;
